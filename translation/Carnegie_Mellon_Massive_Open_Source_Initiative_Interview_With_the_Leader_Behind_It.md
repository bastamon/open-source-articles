In March, Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) announced an unprecedented initiative. Over the course of the year, they plan to release dozens of digital learning tools they have developed over the past decade on an open-source license. These include the learning analytics platform LearnSphere and their pioneering adaptive learning project the Open Learning Initiative (OLI). In all, CMU estimates $100 million in grants and university funding went into these efforts. The effort was spearheaded by the Simon Initiative, which continues the legacy of Nobel Laureate, Turing Award recipient, and CMU professor Herbert Simon.

今年3月，卡内基梅隆大学（Carnegie Mellon University, CMU）宣布了一项前所未有的举措。在过去的一年里，他们计划发布几十个数字学习工具，这些工具都是他们在过去十年里在开源许可的基础上开发的。其中包括学习分析平台LearnSphere以及他们首创的适应性学习项目——开放学习项目 (Open learning Initiative, OLI)。总之，卡内基梅隆大学预估将筹款1亿美元的资金和大学基金用于该举措的实施。这项举措将由Simon计划主导，以纪念即已故的诺贝尔奖和图灵奖得主，曾任教于卡内基梅隆大学的——赫伯特·西蒙教授。

Simon made numerous contributions in various fields throughout his lifetime. But in education, he is remembered for the concept of learning engineering. As Simon wrote on the subject, “Most of us were trained as teachers by serving as TA’s in a couple of classes when we were graduate students; and our students, with rare exceptions, have never received any systematic and consistent instruction in how to learn. Yet that is the skill they have been exercising every working day of their lives for more years than they would like to remember. So students don’t study the skills of learning, and university teachers don’t study the skills of teaching.”

西蒙教授一生在各个领域做出了许多贡献。但在教育领域，他受铭记主要成就是他在学习工程学中的研究理念。正如西蒙所写，“我们多数研究生都会穿梭于不同的班级，通过担任助教来获得教师培训经验的;但我校的学生，除了少数个例外，都从来都没接受过任何系统的和一致的学习指导。然而，他们虽然日复一日地在每个工作日中被培养的这种技能，却不愿自己去总结吸纳。所以最终结果就是学生不会总结学习技巧，授课老师也没能总结出授人以渔的方法。”

By promoting learning engineering, Simon hoped to both study the process of teaching and learning as academics do their own fields and disciplines, and then apply what they’ve learned to improve their own classrooms.

西蒙希望通过在学习工程学的推动研究，那些在各自领域和学科中研究教学方法的学者，能把他们的研究成果应用到改善自己的课堂上去。

Norman Bier is the director of both the Simon Initiative and the OLI [Website]. He has a unique perspective on university-created edtech products. Besides being on campus while other CMU edtech efforts such as Acrobatiq were developed and brought to market, he used to work for iCarnegie. While not strictly a software company, iCarnegie sought to train software developers much like coding bootcamps do today.

Norman Bier是Simon计划和开放学习项目网站的负责人。他对大学开发的EdTech产品有着独特的见解。当卡内基梅隆大学还在对诸如Acrobatiq等其它的edtech项目进行开发和市场推广时，Norman Bier在学校之余，就已经开始在为iCarnegie打工。虽然iCarnegie并不是一家严格意义上的软件公司，但它那时起就已经着手像当今的编程训练营一样去培训软件开发人员。

IBL News reached Bier to hear more about CMU’s massive open-source effort.

IBL新闻最近对Norman Bier进行采访，打听到更多关于卡内基梅隆大学在大规模开源上的努力。

**Henry Kronk:** Naturally, the main thing I’d like to know is why do this open-source initiative in the first place?

**Henry Kronk:** 显然，我们首先想知道的是，为什么你们一开始要做这个开源项目?

**Norman Bier:** Carnegie Mellon doesn’t have a college of education. But at the same time, we’ve got a really rich tradition of interesting work at the place where psychology, cognitive science, human-computer interaction, and computer science intersect. We’ve got a rich tradition of building sort of weird cross-discipline teams that you don’t always see in other institutions. Particularly from Herb Simon’s influence, we’ve got this deep tradition of thinking seriously about how to improve learning.

**Norman Bier:** 卡内基梅隆大学并没有教育研究学院。但即便在这种情况下，我们在心理学、认知科学、人机交互和计算机科学交叉的领域，却有着丰富的兴趣培养文化。我们会建立一些古怪的跨学科团队，这在其他教育机构并不常见。但在赫伯·西蒙的影响下，我们培养出了一种校园文化——让我们深刻思考有哪些可以改善学习的方法。

What we’ve had from these collaborations are some really exciting and impactful individual projects that range from things like our work in cognitive tutors (in the algebra space, we’ve seen use of the tutors can help K-12 students get an additional year’s worth of training compared to their traditional peers) There’s also the OLI. The OLI is probably best known for its work in statistics where we saw roughly twice the learning outcomes in half the time. But there are a whole host of other things as well from virtual chemistry labs to new tutoring approaches in second language acquisition to educational data mining—lots and lots of work in this space that we’re really proud of.

某些跨学科的合作研究项目是非常有效且激动人心的, 比如我们开放学习项目在认知指导领域中的研究(就代数空间学而言，我们发现，与接受传统教育同龄人相比，接受教师辅导的K-12年级学生额外获得了一年多的学习成果)。开放学习项目最出色的成果可能是源于它的统计工作，我们在这些统计资料中发现了学生事半功倍的规律。但开放学习项目的研究领域还有很多，从虚拟化学实验室到学习二外的辅导新方法，再到教育的数据挖掘——该领域的还有很多工作值得称赞。

**Henry Kronk:** How is CMU education research applied?

**Henry Kronk:** 那么，卡内基梅隆大学的教育研究成果又是如何运用的呢?

**Norman Bier:** We don’t always see this work being used here on campus for CMU students’ benefit. Despite some of the impressive numbers I’ve just cited, we don’t always see this work getting out into the world in a way that has a real impact in terms of improving learning. Although I do think we collaborate as well as anyone, even here, we often see that projects don’t always integrate well. Sometimes we see replication of effort. So the Simon Initiative was launched to better interconnect and accelerate the work that is happening in this space to position it in a way so that we can really use these tools but also these techniques and approaches we have been developing to transform the learning experience for Carnegie Mellon students, to also get it out into the world in ways that have a broader impact and improve learning outcomes more globally.

**Norman Bier:** 我们发现跨学科交流并不总是能起到改善卡内基梅隆大学内学生们的学习能力。尽管有我刚才提到的那些令人印象深刻的数据，但该项工作并非一直都被认同是一种可在现实中运用的、能提高学习的方法。尽管我认为这些跨学科研究已经合作得很好了，但即便在本校，有些项目还是难以达到理想的融合。有时我们只能看到重复性的徒劳工作。所以西蒙计划的推行旨在于加强跨学科交流过程中的互连和加速过程，以便我们既可以使用这些工具，还可以运用我们一直以来开发的这些技术和方法，来改变卡内基梅隆大学内学生们的学习体验，让他们有更多的方式来接触世界，从而对他们产生更深远的影响，全面地提升他们的学习成果。

In a lot of ways, we follow Herb Simon’s challenge to his colleagues at the end of his career—that if we want to improve learning, we need to stop thinking about it as teaching and start creating it as a community-based research activity … In some ways, our charge is if we don’t have a college of education, we should treat the entire university as a college of education and make the classroom a learning laboratory.

在很多方面,我校都遵循着赫伯特·西蒙任教晚期所提出的教学理念——“如果要提高学生们的学习能力,我们应不再思考如何去授课而是鼓励学生们举办以社区为基础的研究活动”……换言之,假设能取消面授的大学课堂,我们主张把整个大学的教育内容投入到学习实验室中去。

With this diversity of approaches and tools, we need to think about what is common across the work. This is where we really emphasize the ‘learning engineering approach.’

有了这些多种多样的方法和工具，我们该思考跨学科研究中学科之间的相似之处。这便是我们强调“学习工程方法”的真正原因。

Over the years, we’ve been thinking about how to position these tools and approaches in a way that will have the greatest amount of impact. How do we get more people to engage with them?

多年以来，我们一直在思考如何定位这些工具和方法，才能让它们发挥最大价值。问题是我们应如何令更多的人参与进来?

**Henry Kronk:** Why take this approach compared to a more traditional, for-profit go-to-market strategy?

**Henry Kronk:** 那为什么要用这种方法进入市场，而不是以更传统、以盈利为目的的策略进入市场呢?

**Norman Bier:** Particularly in the educational technology space, there are some real challenges in the traditional tech transfer approach. I think that, broadly speaking, the edtech market is not one that broadly emphasizes or rewards effectiveness. Too often, we see these really effective approaches get pushed out into the market and then they end up needing to pivot to focus on the things that are going to help them sell, rather than the things that made the product effective in the first place.

**Norman Bier:** 传统的技术的转让方式存在着一些阻力，在教育技术领域尤为如此。我认为，宏观上，Edtech市场并没有获得众多殊荣或点评。更多的时候，我们仅能观望着这些真正有效的方法被推向市场，然后营销从业者们聚焦如何兜售产品的买点上，而非强调产品本身的效能上。

Most of this work still needs to be embedded in its research. We’re not at a point where any of this is mature and the research is finished. But rather, when we think about this as part of an engineering effort, we see this real need to staying close to this ongoing research, recognizing where we have new questions that we’re asking, and if we start to really push on this notion that every new learning experience that we’re designing represents a hypothesis, staying close to the toolset, staying close to the approach becomes really important.

跨学科交流的大部分工作仍需深入研究。目前，还没有产品研发到成熟的阶段。我们意识到该研究关乎着整个工程的一部分,虽然知道未来会有新问题的出现,但即便如此,我们很清楚该项研究仍值得持续性的投入。而且学校如果一旦接受这种认为“每个创新的学习体验都代表着一个假设”的理念，那么拥护支持工具集和方法就会变得很重要。

As we’ve investigated new ways towards getting this learning engineering approach broadly used, more broadly accepted, it became increasingly clear that we didn’t have a perfect existing model to tie into.

随着我们继续探求新的推广策略以使这种学习工程的方法得到广泛地接受和应用，我们越来越清楚地认识到，我们没有一个完美的现有模型。

The tech transfer approach wasn’t going to work. We started saying, ‘Maybe we’ll think about CMU just building this stuff for the world. We can build the world’s best statistics course, everyone can use that.’

技术转让的方法是行不通的。于是我们主张，‘也许可以考虑让卡内基梅隆大学为全世界打造学习工程学。我们可以开设世界上最好的统计学课程，让每个人都学会使用它。”

**Henry Kronk:** So then, what specifically is attractive about the open-sourcing model?

**Henry Kronk:** 那么，开源的推广模式有什么特别吸引人的地方呢?

**Norman Bier:** Our ongoing research keeps showing us that 1) there is no perfect statistics course for the world and 2) cultural context is so important for learning that what we really need to do (if we think these tools and approaches are important) is position them in ways such that folks can deploy them in their own context with their own learners’ needs in mind. And if we were going to learn from that approach, we need to position this work in a way that the results coming back from those efforts can come back in a way that we and the rest of the community can see them.

**Norman Bier:** 我们目前进行中的研究不断地表明出,1)世上没有完美的统计学课程；2)文化背景相当重要,以至于我们的主要任务就是将它们摆进合适的位置(前提是我们认为这些工具和方法都有重要作用),就如求学者可以按照自己的需求把干货写进文章的那样。如果我们要从该方法中从中受益，那么我们则需要明确该工作的定位，以确保工作的努力成果能被自己和社区里的大家所看到。

This really started pushing us to more of a community-based approach and that in turn led us to this notion that we need to be more open about our work.

这的确推动了我们众多以社区为基础的方法的发展，此外这也同时反过来影响了我们的观念，需要大家更加开放地对待我们的工作。

By opening up these tools and opening up the software, I’m not sure that I’m trying to encourage every institution out there to spin up their own instance of the DataShop platform. That’s 1) not very efficient and 2) for a lot of the folks we’re trying to see impacted, they don’t have the resources or expertise to do this. But in order to encourage this use of some of the centralized tools and centralized approaches, that code base was sort of table stakes. It was a way of saying, ‘Look, you can count on the fact that this stuff won’t disappear because it’s out here for you.’

虽然有开放这些工具和软件，我还是不太自信自己的鼓励能使每个机构都能去建立自己的数据跳平台实例。这是因为1)它的效率不高；2)对于我们这些试图观察到影响作用的人来说，他们没有资质或专业知识来完成这件事。但为了鼓励人们使用一些集中的工具和方法，代码库有点像一场博弈。就好像在说，‘瞧，你可以相信的，这些东西不会消失，因为它就在这里等着你。’

**As an Alternative to the Tech Transfer Approach, Carnegie Mellon Will Open-Source Dozens of Internally Developed EdTech Tools**

**作为技术转移的一种替代手段，卡内基梅隆大学将对外公布一批由内部开发的EdTech工具源代码。**

In March, Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) announced an unprecedented initiative. Over the course of the year, they plan to release dozens of digital learning tools they have developed over the past decade on an open-source license. These include the learning analytics platform LearnSphere and their pioneering adaptive learning project the Open Learning Initiative (OLI). In all, CMU estimates $100 million in grants and university funding went into these efforts. The effort was spearheaded by the Simon Initiative, which continues the legacy of Nobel Laureate, Turing Award recipient, and CMU professor Herbert Simon.

今年3月，卡内基梅隆大学（Carnegie Mellon University, CMU）宣布了一项前所未有的举措。在过去的一年里，他们计划发布几十个数字学习工具，这些工具都是他们在过去十年里在开源许可的基础上开发的。其中包括学习分析平台LearnSphere以及他们首创的适应性学习项目Open learning Initiative (OLI)。总之，卡内基梅隆大学预估将筹款1亿美元的资金和大学基金用于该举措的实施。这项举措将由西蒙计划主导，以纪念即已故的诺贝尔奖和图灵奖得主，曾任教于卡内基梅隆大学的——赫伯特·西蒙教授。

Simon made numerous contributions in various fields throughout his lifetime. But in education, he is remembered for the concept of learning engineering. As Simon wrote on the subject, “Most of us were trained as teachers by serving as TA’s in a couple of classes when we were graduate students; and our students, with rare exceptions, have never received any systematic and consistent instruction in how to learn. Yet that is the skill they have been exercising every working day of their lives for more years than they would like to remember. So students don’t study the skills of learning, and university teachers don’t study the skills of teaching.”

西蒙教授一生在各个领域做出了许多贡献。但在教育领域，人们铭记的是他在学习工程学上的研究理念。正如西蒙所写的，“我们大多数研究生都会穿梭于不同的班级，通过担任助教来获得教师培训经验的;我们的学生，除了少数例外，都从来没有接受过任何系统的和一致的学习指导。然而，他们日复一日，在每个工作日中被培养的这种技能，却不愿自己去总结吸纳。所以最终结果就是学生不会总结学习技巧，大学老师也不去总结授课的技巧。”

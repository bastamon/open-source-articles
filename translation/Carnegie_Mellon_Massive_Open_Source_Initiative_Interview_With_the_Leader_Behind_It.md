## As an Alternative to the Tech Transfer Approach, Carnegie Mellon Will Open-Source Dozens of Internally Developed EdTech Tools

## 作为技术转移的一种替代手段，卡内基梅隆大学将对外公布一批由内部开发的EdTech工具源代码

In March, Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) announced an unprecedented initiative. Over the course of the year, they plan to release dozens of digital learning tools they have developed over the past decade on an open-source license. These include the learning analytics platform LearnSphere and their pioneering adaptive learning project the Open Learning Initiative (OLI). In all, CMU estimates $100 million in grants and university funding went into these efforts. The effort was spearheaded by the Simon Initiative, which continues the legacy of Nobel Laureate, Turing Award recipient, and CMU professor Herbert Simon.

今年3月，卡内基梅隆大学（Carnegie Mellon University, CMU）宣布了一项前所未有的举措。在过去的一年里，他们计划发布几十个数字学习工具，这些工具都是他们在过去十年里在开源许可的基础上开发的。其中包括学习分析平台LearnSphere以及他们首创的适应性学习项目——开放学习项目 (Open learning Initiative, OLI)。总之，卡内基梅隆大学预估将筹款1亿美元的资金和大学基金用于该举措的实施。这项举措将由Simon计划主导，以纪念即已故的诺贝尔奖和图灵奖得主，曾任教于卡内基梅隆大学的——赫伯特·西蒙教授。

Simon made numerous contributions in various fields throughout his lifetime. But in education, he is remembered for the concept of learning engineering. As Simon wrote on the subject, “Most of us were trained as teachers by serving as TA’s in a couple of classes when we were graduate students; and our students, with rare exceptions, have never received any systematic and consistent instruction in how to learn. Yet that is the skill they have been exercising every working day of their lives for more years than they would like to remember. So students don’t study the skills of learning, and university teachers don’t study the skills of teaching.”

西蒙教授一生在各个领域做出了许多贡献。但在教育领域，他受铭记主要是是他在学习工程学上的研究理念。正如西蒙所写，“我们多数研究生都会穿梭于不同的班级，通过担任助教来获得教师培训经验的;但我们的学生，除了少数例外，都从来都没接受过任何系统的和一致的学习指导。然而，他们虽然日复一日地在每个工作日中被培养的这种技能，却不愿自己去总结吸纳。所以最终结果就是学生不会总结学习技巧，大学老师也没能总结出授人以渔的技巧。”

By promoting learning engineering, Simon hoped to both study the process of teaching and learning as academics do their own fields and disciplines, and then apply what they’ve learned to improve their own classrooms.

西蒙希望通过在学习工程学的推动研究，那些在各自领域和学科中研究教学方法的学者，能把他们的研究成果应用到改善自己的课堂上去。

Norman Bier is the director of both the Simon Initiative and the OLI [Website]. He has a unique perspective on university-created edtech products. Besides being on campus while other CMU edtech efforts such as Acrobatiq were developed and brought to market, he used to work for iCarnegie. While not strictly a software company, iCarnegie sought to train software developers much like coding bootcamps do today.

Norman Bier是Simon计划和开放学习项目网站的负责人。他对大学开发的EdTech产品有着独特的见解。当卡内基梅隆大学还在对诸如Acrobatiq等其它的edtech项目进行开发并推广市场时，Norman Bier在学校之余，已经开始为iCarnegie打工。虽然iCarnegie并不是一家严格意义上的软件公司，但它已经开始力图如今天的编程训练营一样培训软件开发人员。

IBL News reached Bier to hear more about CMU’s massive open-source effort.

IBL新闻最近对Norman Bier进行采访，打听到了更多关于卡内基梅隆大学在大规模开源上的努力。

**Henry Kronk:** Naturally, the main thing I’d like to know is why do this open-source initiative in the first place?

**Henry Kronk:** 显然，我们首先想知道的是，为什么你们一开始要做这个开源项目?

**Norman Bier:** Carnegie Mellon doesn’t have a college of education. But at the same time, we’ve got a really rich tradition of interesting work at the place where psychology, cognitive science, human-computer interaction, and computer science intersect. We’ve got a rich tradition of building sort of weird cross-discipline teams that you don’t always see in other institutions. Particularly from Herb Simon’s influence, we’ve got this deep tradition of thinking seriously about how to improve learning.

**Norman Bier:** 卡内基梅隆大学并没有教育学院。但即便在这种情况下，我们在心理学、认知科学、人机交互和计算机科学交叉的领域，却有着丰富的兴趣培养文化。我们会建立一些古怪阔学科的团队，这在其他教育机构并不常见。但在赫伯·西蒙的影响下，我们培养出了一种校园文化——让我们深刻思考有哪些可以改善学习的方法。

What we’ve had from these collaborations are some really exciting and impactful individual projects that range from things like our work in cognitive tutors (in the algebra space, we’ve seen use of the tutors can help K-12 students get an additional year’s worth of training compared to their traditional peers) There’s also the OLI. The OLI is probably best known for its work in statistics where we saw roughly twice the learning outcomes in half the time. But there are a whole host of other things as well from virtual chemistry labs to new tutoring approaches in second language acquisition to educational data mining—lots and lots of work in this space that we’re really proud of.

某些跨学科的合作研究项目是非常有效且激动人心的, 比如我们开放学习项目在认知指导领域中的研究(就代数空间学而言，我们发现，与接受传统教育同龄人相比，接受教师辅导的K-12年级学生额外获得了一年多的学习成果)。开放学习项目最出色的成果可能是源于它的统计工作，我们在这些统计资料中发现了学生事半功倍的规律。但开放学习项目的研究领域还有很多，从虚拟化学实验室到学习二外的辅导新方法，再到教育的数据挖掘——该领域的还有很多工作值得称赞。

**Henry Kronk:** How is CMU education research applied?

**Henry Kronk:** 那么，卡内基梅隆大学的教育研究成果又是如何运用的呢?

**Norman Bier:** We don’t always see this work being used here on campus for CMU students’ benefit. Despite some of the impressive numbers I’ve just cited, we don’t always see this work getting out into the world in a way that has a real impact in terms of improving learning. Although I do think we collaborate as well as anyone, even here, we often see that projects don’t always integrate well. Sometimes we see replication of effort. So the Simon Initiative was launched to better interconnect and accelerate the work that is happening in this space to position it in a way so that we can really use these tools but also these techniques and approaches we have been developing to transform the learning experience for Carnegie Mellon students, to also get it out into the world in ways that have a broader impact and improve learning outcomes more globally.

**Norman Bier:** 我们发现跨学科合作并不总是能起到改善卡内基梅隆大学内学生们学习的作用。尽管我刚才引用的那些令人印象深刻的数据，但该项工作并非一直都被认同是一种可在现实中运用的，能提高学习的方法。尽管我认为这些研究已经合作得很好了，但即使在本校，有部分项目还是难以达到理想的融合。有时我们只能看到重复性的徒劳工作。所以西蒙计划的推出旨在改善了跨学科过程中的互连和加速工作，以便我们既可以使用这些工具，还可以运用我们一直以来开发的这些技术和方法，来改变卡内基梅隆大学学生的学习体验，让他们有更多的方式来接触世界，从而对他们产生更深远的影响，全面地提升他们的学习成果。

In a lot of ways, we follow Herb Simon’s challenge to his colleagues at the end of his career—that if we want to improve learning, we need to stop thinking about it as teaching and start creating it as a community-based research activity … In some ways, our charge is if we don’t have a college of education, we should treat the entire university as a college of education and make the classroom a learning laboratory.
